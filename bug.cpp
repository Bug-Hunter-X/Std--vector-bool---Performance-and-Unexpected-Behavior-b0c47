std::vector<bool> is not a good idea.  It's optimized for memory usage, but this optimization comes at the cost of performance and can lead to unexpected behavior.  Because of its specialized memory layout, it doesn't follow the standard container interface perfectly, and operations might not be as efficient as with other containers like `std::vector<char>` or `std::vector<int>`.  This can lead to performance bottlenecks, especially in loops or frequently accessed data.
